         	<p>With the launch of <a href="https://doevery.day">doevery.day</a>, I decided I should register a sitemap. The site is built with Rails 7 and running on <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>, so I set about finding an automated way to make this happen. Here‚Äôs what I came up with.</p>

<p>First I installed the <a href="https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator">sitemap_generator</a> gem. This will handle the grunt work. The documentation does a good job <a href="https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator#adding-links">getting you going</a> and provides for most of the details you‚Äôll need.</p>

<p>From there you should make sure you have a <code>robots.txt</code> defined (<a href="https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">docs</a>). Here‚Äôs ours:</p>

<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://doevery.day/sitemap.xml.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you need to update your render build script (mine is found in <code>./bin/render-build.sh</code>. Add this to your script:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec rake sitemap:refresh
</code></pre>

<p>And that should do it! You will have a sitemap after your next deploy.</p>

<p>(I‚Äôll admit I did run this in my local environment to make sure my code worked. You should probably do that with the <code>rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping</code> command. I forgot. I hope I didn‚Äôt make Google and Bing angry!)</p>

It also feels like you have to have a mountain of notes before you can truly analyze if it&rsquo;ll work for you; to answer questions about ease of finding what you&rsquo;re looking for, discoverability, and so on. Does anyone have a shortcut or obvious explaner that helps build confidence here?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently a Bear Notes person, but curious about Obsidian, especially if I can release the shackles of needing to put thoughts into notes organization. I use notes for general life stuff, research across several topics, home ownership notes, developer logbook, etc. TIA!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/03/07/watching-a-musical.html">Watching a Musical Six Times</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Over the prior couple of weeks my oldest has been part of the pit orchestra for the high school musical. She really enjoys musicals in general, and this has been a great way for her to be involved in one. Especially since she‚Äôs not a singer or dancer or actor.</p>

<p>Over the years we‚Äôve noticed that some families who have kids in the musical will go to almost every performance. I always thought this was pretty absurd. It can be as many as seven or eight performances some years and, well, don‚Äôt they have anything better to do?</p>

<p>When my time came to make the obvious decision to spread my time among many various pursuits I made the clear choice and ‚Ä¶ attended almost every one of her performances. There were not many other things going on in my February life. Every afternoon when I thought I‚Äôd sit out that night I realized my evening activities were destined to be watching something on television or playing a video game. My other two daughters as well as my wife wanted to go to the musical every night. So what better choice did I have?</p>

<p>I found seeing the musical over many performances to be a different experience than simply watching a musical one time. It was a little like attending a sporting event. I could see who had stronger performances on a given night. I could see someone stepping up with increased confidence. I could notice changes from prior nights. And like a sporting event, we talked about these differences amongst ourselves when the performance was over.</p>

<p>I gained an appreciation for each kid‚Äôs take on their character. We all have preferences and those often dictate how we judge the quality of a performance at the end of the night. Over time, though, I would realize that the kid who I thought was very mediocre on night one was actually doing some pretty great work with their character. Perhaps I didn‚Äôt love their take on it, but I could tell they were working really hard to do exactly what they were doing.</p>

<p>Do I recommend watching a musical this many times in a short period? I mean, probably not. I actually think with professional performers it would be more boring than with student performers. Professionals probably hit their marks and notes with great accuracy, making a six-performance engagement more similar to watching the same movie six times. If you have a kid involved, though, and if you know a lot of the other student cast members, it can be a pretty interesting way to spend fifteen hours in the dead of winter.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/03/04/are-straigth-as.html">Are Straight A&#39;s Worth It?</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/03/04/are-straigth-as.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-03-07 08:04:00 -0500">Mar 7, 2022</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Spoiler alert: I do not know, but I do have thoughts.</p>

<p>A high-school kid with straight A‚Äôs through all four years of schooling could represent a number of situations. The kid could be a genius. The kid could be smart and a hard worker. The kid could be clever about choosing their classes. The kid could be very good at communicating with their teachers and getting second chances. The kid‚Äôs parents might have any number of the above skills.</p>

<p>There is certainly a financial value to finishing high school with all A‚Äôs. Class ranking can automatically get them scholarships at a number of schools. Class ranking, GPA, and valedictorian status are a part of their financial aid story as well as the story they share on their scholarship applications.</p>

<p>Where it gets more interesting, I think, is when considering how valuable straight A‚Äôs are to the student‚Äôs growth and happiness. For most students, that amount of grade excellence would require a lot of hard work. Most societies around the world consider a strong work ethic to be a positive moral characteristic. (There is a lot of social engineering behind that fact, but this isn‚Äôt the time to delve into that topic.)</p>

<p>It seems likely that a student with straight A‚Äôs has learned a lot of things. Learning things is a good practice in my estimation. I don‚Äôt believe that straight A‚Äôs mean a student learned the <em>most</em> things, though, nor do I think we can know if straight A‚Äôs mean they learned the right things. What if a student had to work incredibly hard at a math class that was particularly challenging to them? Odds are they did not learn that material much beyond getting by (if you can call an A getting by). Odds are they won‚Äôt retain that material. Odds are the time they took struggling with that one class took them away from a more natural, deeper learning they could have been doing in an area in which they were more interested. Or perhaps the stress of that studying took them away from extracurricular or social activities that would have been better for their growth into adulthood?</p>

<p>Along similar lines, students pushing towards these top grades may also be pushing happiness and contentment away during their pursuit. There is certainly an argument that dealing with imperfection in life, with situations that are not perfectly what you want, is a useful skill to learn. No matter how much we hope for an ideal environment, that‚Äôs just never going to be the case for any of us. Conversely, I think we would do our teens good to help them learn to seek fulfillment. It would be good for kids to discover how to discover what they excel at; to be given opportunities to go deep into those areas and learn to build skills around focusing on those topics.</p>

<p>When comparing the extremes, of course I would deem more successful the kid who achieved straight A‚Äôs than the kid who barely passed any of their classes. For the average and above-average kids I don‚Äôt think grades tell as clear of a story. There is certainly data that proves me wrong. That shows grades correlate pretty strongly with common measures of success: career achievements and monetary rewards. Though I suspect many of the highest achievers were not from that straight-A group. I suspect we could do more to foster these less-tangible skills that make for well-rounded, happy, and fulfilled humans, which to me is a truer measure of success.</p>

         	<p>The things I‚Äôm going to say are not news to anyone, but I do think it‚Äôs interesting to feel it happening to me in real time.</p>

<p>Recently I revisited my Twitter account. This is for completely self-serving reasons. As I work on things I have some hope other people will find these things and use them. I figured I might need an avenue to share the things I work on. Why not see if Twitter can be helpful here?</p>

<p>It has been something like eight years. My desire in using Twitter is to basically use at as a publish-only service, with maybe a weekly visit to see if anyone had responded to my Tweets. I‚Äôve done okay with that so far.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm so old I remember that the addictive quality of Twitter used to be about trying to read the entire stream. You would visit it every day and read until you started seeing things you had already seen. Chronological tweets and completionist addictions, how quaint. Of course the stream is no longer ordered. Though I was fully aware this would be the case, it still felt out of place to an old timer like me.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not surprising that Twitter is favoring a lot of content related to the war in Ukraine. I‚Äôm not trying to say it shouldn‚Äôt, but the tweets that are favored in my timeline sure are something‚Ä¶special. I wasn‚Äôt completely aware that I was being manipulated at first. It was when a name from my past popped into my head and I wondered if he was still on Twitter. I hadn‚Äôt seen him writing in my weekly checks, so it seemed likely that he had got off the train. It was rather surprising to me when I went directly to his Twitter profile and found he was reasonably active on the platform. The platform just didn‚Äôt feel the need to show me his slice-of-life observations.</p>

<p>His tweets were sweet relief from the conspirational cess pool that Twitter was showing me instead. Again, I‚Äôm not suggesting that Twitter should shield me from such a major, disheartening event as the war on Ukraine, but it was eye-opening to realize the algorithm‚Äôs preference was to provide me with the most inane and offensive theories, like things floating up from the sewers.</p>

<p>Even when you‚Äôre well aware of it, the doom-scrolling of the Internet is so invasive that it still surprises you. So many brains have been boiled like frogs. I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs possible to pull our societies out of this spiral.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/03/03/using-a-kinesis.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-03-03 14:06:00 -0500">Mar 3, 2022</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôve recently been trying to code with a new <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/09/im-coding-more.html">Kinesis</a> <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/09/im-coding-more.html">keyboard</a>. Since this particular keyboard remaps many of the keys, it‚Äôs been quite a mind bending experience, but it‚Äôs getting better. One other thing I thought I‚Äôd try is to take advantage of Kinesis‚Äôs 60-day trial period and pick up a set of <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/products/#foot-switches">foot pedals</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first things I thought could be useful with a pedal was tying it to the shift key. I never use the caps lock, so when there are moments that I need to type in all caps, I find myself holding the shift key and pretzeling my fingers around the keyboard to get everything written. There was one problem, however. From Joey in support:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly, there is a limitation with Mac OS where one USB device (pedal) cannot modify another USB device (keyboard/built in keyboard), meaning that you cannot use modifiers on your pedals in combination with another device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combining shift from the pedal with a key from the keyboard, a separate USB device, was not going to work out of the box. Enter <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">Karbiner-Elements</a>. I had heard rumblings in my research that this device could fix my situation, but none of the rumblings really explained very clearly how to make it work. Let‚Äôs see if I can explain it.</p>

<p>There are two steps to get this working. First, follow the Kinesis instructions to program your pedal for a <strong>Single Action</strong> of <strong>Shift</strong>, using the <strong>left shift</strong> key to program enter your single-action program. (Left versus right shift isn‚Äôt important. It‚Äôs just necessary to be consistent as you configure this stuff.) Make sure to set your pedal into programming mode, get the updates saved to the pedal, and then set it back to play mode when you‚Äôre done.</p>

<p><a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/b74353297a.png"><img src="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/b74353297a.png" width="600" height="378" alt=‚Äúkinesis configuration‚Äú /></a></p>

<p>Secondly install <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">Karbiner-Elements</a> and go to the <strong>Simple Modifications</strong> tab. Select your <strong>Target device</strong> as your keyboard (in my case <strong>Advantage2 Keyboard</strong>). Finally, and this is weird, but <strong>Add item</strong> and define the <strong>From key</strong> as <strong>left_shift</strong> and the <strong>To key</strong> as <strong>left_shift</strong>. This will magically allow your shift pedal to modify your keyboard! ALL CAPS GALORE!</p>

<p><a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/fc697dba91.png"><img src="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/fc697dba91.png" width="600" height="346" alt=‚Äúkarbiner-elements‚Äù /></a></p>

<p>You can use this to allow modification with shift or control or option or whatever else you‚Äôre after. Much better!</p>

<p>(Note, after all this I still might not keep the pedal. I can see uses for it, but the ergonomics are pretty challenging for someone that stands at his desk for the entire day. It seems to be better suited for use while sitting.)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/28/trying-phoenix-and.html">Trying Phoenix and Elixir</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/28/trying-phoenix-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-03-01 07:58:00 -0500">Mar 1, 2022</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Earlier this year I surprised myself and <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/04/google-programming-in.html">got back into daily programming</a>. It‚Äôs been quite a trip and mostly fun. The part that has been the most frustrating is when I solve a problem one week only to have the same problem again next week, but I can‚Äôt quite remember how I solved it. I have tried to minimize that issue a bit by keeping <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/02/16/logtxt.html">a log</a>.</p>

<p>Just when I‚Äôve started to get rolling, I am surprising myself again by picking up <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> for my next project. About eighteen months ago, before this web-project bug hit me, I did try to book-learn myself some Phoenix. Without a project to work on, or even a desire to come up with a project, I fell off the practice rather quickly.</p>

<p>I have never been a deep-diver of programming languages and frameworks. I don‚Äôt find the details of how things work to be that interesting on their own. I find the fact that these open source tools <em>exist</em> at all to be the amazing part, and it turns out I very much enjoy them to build things. The quickly-built things are what excite me.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. After standing up three prototypes with Ruby on Rails, I reminded myself of another thing that really makes me happy: fast websites. I‚Äôm building prototypes here, with hopes no higher than eventually serving a few thousand people on an app that catches on in its little niche. There is no practical reason for me to move from Rails. It‚Äôs certainly fast enough to handle the things I want to build. As experience is (re)gained, the workflow is quite nice. And while it‚Äôs hard to find things on Google, there is a lot of hard-won knowledge out there, including my own experiences with the framework, which are certainly buried somewhere in my brain.</p>

<p>Elixir and the Phoenix framework promise better performance on the basic web things; probably by a factor of five or ten. On top of that, the authors were inspired by Ruby and Rails, so they have been able to largely keep the ‚Äúdeveloper happiness‚Äù goals of those inspirational technologies alive in their own developments.</p>

<p>As I go through the book learning, it has been remarkably quick to stand up a simple application in Phoenix. Certainly I will be slowed down as I learn to embrace a new framework, a new mode of programming (functional declarative rather than object oriented), and a less-magical way of doing things. Okay, the latter might net out positive very quickly.</p>

<p>I realize the performance of my applications might not be all that noticeable, especially if they include multimedia assets like photos and videos, but the promise of simply not worrying about scaling for a very long time is a good one. The promise of apps that are not resource-needy and that are cheap to run is great for someone building many prototypes each year. The promise of serving thousands of connections cheaply for live websocket interactions is quite exciting. The promise of tests that run blazingly fast makes me smile.</p>

<p>So here I go. Maybe I‚Äôll be even happier building apps over the next couple months. Or maybe I‚Äôll fall back to Rails, my comfort zone. Either option will be a pretty great place to be.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of the <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/mainlib">Libby app</a>. It is fairly pretty, makes managing my want-to-read lists pretty easy, and does a bang-up job shuttling off checked-out books to my Kindle. It tries some unique user interfaces, and they don‚Äôt all succeed, but I appreciate the effort.</p>

<p>(Aside, I remember the old OverDrive app being pretty terrible, so I will say ‚ÄúHats Off!‚Äù to them because <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">they made Libby</a>. Well done!)</p>

<p>While reading up on what sorts of long-form journalism are actually worth anything these days, I discovered that my local library actually has free issues of many magazines for digital checkout. While I prefer reading on paper (or Kindle), a tablet isn‚Äôt too bad of a format in which to read magazines; especially as I‚Äôm just trying out if I really <em>want</em> to be reading long-form journalism again. If it becomes a thing I value, I‚Äôll probably subscribe to the magazine(s) directly.</p>

<p>Libby will also offer to subscribe you to the digital magazine, alerting you when the next issue hits the stands. I‚Äôll leave it to you to discover what magazines are worthwhile.</p>

<p>My fascination level doubled when I realized there was no backend to this software. The state of what has been typed on the screen is stored in the URL, compressed and base64 encoded.

<p>This state-in-the-URL is handy for my financial <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/26/tab-groups-in.html">tab group</a>.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Through the years I have participated in all sorts of groups. There have been sports teams, both individually focused and team focused. There have been staff positions, working as a group to support students. There have been traditional jobs, which generally combine both the individual competition with group support.</p>

<p>Out of all these my favorite form of group activity has been the musical group. A successful musical group is trying to lift everyone in the group up. While there are often soloists and ‚Äústar players,‚Äù the importance of each participant is nearly identical. So the group tries to encourage and inspire their lesser players to rise to the occasion.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt seem to result in a homogenization of talent, but rather a growth of skills across all the participants. Everyone feels like they could be better. Everyone‚Äôs efforts matter. My high school band director liked to compare it to athletic teams when he would say, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs a starter.‚Äù</p>

<p>It strikes me as curious that there are not a lot of successful examples of this attitude in business. I‚Äôve seen some similarities as I‚Äôve looked at young businesses. On paper they have the intention to be a supportive group that builds each other up. As they grow they write <em>more</em> about this intention while building structures directly in conflict with that goal. Creating salary bands and role differentiation that explicitly says, ‚ÄúThese jobs are not of the same value.‚Äù</p>

<p>I wonder if a business could be built and maintained in a way that carries on indefinitely the idea of a supportive group where everyone is a starter? I wonder if human nature would allow the participants to maintain that attitude over many years of working together? I wonder how compensation could be defined to best support this structure?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to leave those things as questions for now. Perhaps they are good fodder for future thinking.</p>

         	<p>With the projects I‚Äôm working on right now I have found myself creating a log.txt file in each project&rsquo;s folder. Since I‚Äôm working in code, these files are even stored in source control. They are there for anyone working on the project to update, though there are generally only two of us working in the project and I&rsquo;m the only one using the file.</p>

<p>Probably what these files in each project need to be is a developer log. A README can be used for project-specific discoveries that need shared with multiple people. I know there are softwares out there designed just for this dev log purpose, but I&rsquo;m hesitant to pick up one more writing tool (iA Writer, Bear Notes, Sublime Text, Micro.blog, Write.as, etc). Editing a text file with whatever software I please might be the way to go.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I used Automator with keyboard shortcuts to open up a text file in my view, name it, and plop in whatever it is I learned at the moment. It was pretty nice, but when it comes to dev logs I think that a single file has its advantages. It is easily searchable in one spot. Text files could work, though it might be nice to have a little styling with clickable links and formatting.</p>

<p>I wonder how many years I would have to write in the file before it became too big and unweildy?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As I came of age in the programming community circa 2007-2010 it was a running joke that programming is basically knowing just enough to be able to Google for the answer. Perhaps it‚Äôs nostalgia, but now that I‚Äôm revisiting that greenfield programming life in 2022 I‚Äôm finding my work as a Google programmer to be way less successful.</p>

<p>My weapon of choice is still <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, but returning to that land 15 years after I first visited is quite a different experience. Back in 2007 all the conversation around Rails was fresh and recent. After all there were only three years worth of search results to be indexed. Granted, if you found a solution from 2004 or 2005 it probably would be out-of-date in 2007, but the discussions were fresh enough to likely be updated with new pointers to the proper solution.</p>

<p>My last significant Rails programming came during Rails 3 and Rails 4. Launching today‚Äôs new Rails app means Rails 7. That‚Äôs quite a distance! Now when I search Google for ‚Äúhas_and_belongs_to_many‚Äù, I generally get results dating as far back as 2011. Naturally I have my doubts when I pull up a Stack Overflow answer from over a decade ago. It probably won‚Äôt answer the question accurately, but will it even answer the question conceptually? Who really knows?! (And, no, I don‚Äôt find DuckDuckGo to do any better here.)</p>

<p>On top of that, Google results are so gamed by the machines serving information to the algorithm. In general search just stinks these days, which is part of why I am enjoying finding the indie web underneath the web we know today. (I know there is also an upper-case IndieWeb, though I don‚Äôt really know what that means.) Generally terrible search on top of this historical mountain of information makes things less than good. I think they‚Äôre related as the search engines are not learning to prioritize the freshest answers to programming questions. In the old days I would have written posts about the things I couldn‚Äôt find, knowing the algorithm would help others find these answers later. I no longer have faith that the search engines will be that helpful.</p>

<p>The good thing about all this is that I‚Äôm doing better in stepping away from the Google programmer mentality. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time on <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org">Rails Guides</a>. I bought the latest <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/">AWDwR</a> (though it is disappointingly in an incomplete beta). I‚Äôm doing good at <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org">reading the docs</a>.</p>

<p>Though I can‚Äôt help but wonder if trying a newer framework, like <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a>, would be more productive since it has a much shorter history to index. Maybe then I could become a productive Google programmer again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to read along with each of the kids on at least one book series (RE: <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-hunger-games-hunger-games-book-one-1-1a7c660f-79bf-4683-8109-d7c8f2deee51/9780439023528">The Hunger Games</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/found-1/9781416954217">Found</a>), and now it&rsquo;s time to read with the youngest.

<p>This is my favorite Thai restaurant order and Chef John is probably my favorite YouTube chef. I made it last week using serrano peppers. While it was cooking, each person in the family started coughing in turn. Some of the kids were 20-30 feet away! We were all coughing for the last 5 minutes of cooking time. It was pretty spicy, but not unbearable like I thought it was going to be. We still gobbled it up.</p>

<p>The picture doesn&rsquo;t do it a lot of justice.</p>

<p>It took a bit for me to get into the movie, but by the end I was quite fascinated by <em>Dolemite Is My Name</em>. Midway through, Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s Rudy Ray Moore mocks a film producer&rsquo;s plans to make a saccrine underdog story, all the while participating in a film full of joy and positivity from its own underdog. The movie is truly Capraesque, despite the extensive language and nudity.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I get made fun of for using Safari as my primary web browser. I use an iPhone as well as a Mac, and that‚Äôs basically the reason it started. When the Safaris across those devices are sharing information, things seem to work a little better. URLs complete better. I can go into Safari on my computer and see the 200 tabs open on my mobile browser. I can clean up those tabs by <a href="https://pinboard.in">bookmarking</a> them or taking notes on them, and then I can close those mobile tabs from my computer.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs pretty convenient. Probably some things in my web experience don‚Äôt work as well, but I guess I generally don‚Äôt know? And when I do, I can open Firefox.</p>

<p>A fairly new Safari feature that landed with little fanfare is <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/group-tabs-ibrwa2d73908/mac">Tab Groups</a>. It allows you to collect a group of tabs into a sort of dynamic group bookmark. I love this feature!</p>

<p>For example, I have a tab group for blogging. It started with the following tabs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, which is where I post</li>
<li>A <a href="https://gist.github.com/bjhess/627249fdc95a8e71254de79a3e4e9647">GitHub Gist</a> that includes copy-paste intros for my micro posts</li>
<li>A search window for finding screencaps</li>
<li><a href="https://edit.photo">edit.photo</a> for resizing said images</li>
<li>Then tabs for linking microposts to movie, music, book, video game, and board game information.</li>
</ul>

<p>This just sounds like a folder of bookmarks, but it‚Äôs not. The grouping is dynamic. This means when you close all the tabs and reopen them later, the pages you were on in the last session are still there even if those pages are different from when you first created the tab group. This means when you decide to microblog about crocheting, you can add a tab to look up yarn colors and it will be there the next time you open the tab group.</p>

<p>When you open a tab group, it‚Äôs instantly there. The pages appear to be open constantly, which probably has a cost in memory. I haven‚Äôt noticed any performance issues.</p>

<p>On a Mac you navigate between tabs with ‚åò+‚å•+‚Üí and ‚åò+‚å•+‚Üê. Tab groups use the same format. You can move up and down between all of your groups with ‚åò+‚å•+‚Üì and ‚åò+‚å•+‚Üë. It‚Äôs convenient!</p>

<p>As you probably expect, you can open these tab groups on your other connected devices as well. I haven‚Äôt used this much, but these tab groups are available across my computer and phone and tablet. I think the best use case of this would be if you‚Äôre, say, researching a new lawn mower. If you had some time waiting in your car for school to let out, open the tab group and find the latest tab you were reading about the subject. (I mean my actual recommendation in that situation is to listen to music and look around the world. Take some time to see, hear, smell. But I digress‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>Oh, and the biggest win of this ease of use? No more 10  different research windows with 15 tabs open in my browser forever because I‚Äôll get back to that topic someday soon and I hope things don‚Äôt ever crash catastrophically making me lose those links for all eternity OH NO! Making a tab group is quicker than making a folder of bookmarks, and I don‚Äôt have to remember to add new bookmarks the next time I touch the topic. Opening a new tab in the tab group means there is a new tab in the tab group. Easy!</p>

<p>My weakly held commitment to Safari is paying off now. Make fun of me all you want!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made this twice now, and it is the real deal. I make only one rice that is better. The marinade is well proportioned. The time it takes me to prepare everything is 50% again what is mentioned in the recipe. That&rsquo;s a running theme, usually to the tune of taking twice as long to prep my ingredients.</p>

<p>The sauces are great. I don&rsquo;t make them in the same proportion as the mains because my kids don&rsquo;t really touch the sauces. I&rsquo;ve had trouble nailing the consistency of the white sauce. The hot sauce has an &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to invest in Big Cayenne&rdquo; amount of cayenne pepper, and I wouldn&rsquo;t sneeze at the amount of red flake in there either. I can&rsquo;t bring myself to keeping pouring when making the red sauce.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s all GOOD. You should make it your own!</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôm standing up a prototype app using Rails and <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>. It wasn‚Äôt too hard to figure out how to get things going - Render‚Äôs docs have been pretty good! But I figured it is worth jotting down a few pointers about what I had to do right now while using a Render <a href="https://render.com/docs/native-environments">native environment</a> and Rails 7.0.1.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Rails guide on <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html">Active Storage</a> is generally great.</li>
<li>You will be using <a href="https://render-web.onrender.com/docs/disks">Render Disks</a> for storage, which means you can no longer stay on the free plan.</li>
<li>Of the available image processing options, Render‚Äôs native environments only include <a href="https://imagemagick.org">imagemagick</a> out of the box, so you will have to use MiniMagick for your processor.

<ul>
<li>This means <code>brew install imagemagick</code></li>
<li>Rails is transitioning to preferring <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-vips/Vips/Image">Vips</a>. While it <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/44211#issuecomment-1017743763">is not documented yet</a>, you will need <code>config.active_storage.variant_processor = :mini_magick</code> in <code>application.rb</code> to get things working.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When setting up your <a href="https://render-web.onrender.com/docs/disks">Disk</a>, note your mount path. I used <code>/storage</code>.</li>

<li><p>Your <code>storage.yml</code> for production should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>production_local:
  service: Disk
  root: '/storage'
</code></pre></li>

<li><p><code>config/environments/production.rb</code> needs:</p>

<pre><code>config.active_storage.service = :production_local
</code></pre></li>

<p>I like how Nick Offerman writes. It inspires me to be more playful with my scribbles. Maybe I can be a little janky, leave some words out, and use a fancy phrase or five for fun. There&rsquo;s definitely a schtick to it and he can spread it too thick at times. One of the themes in the book is &ldquo;nuance,&rdquo; which makes it striking when Offerman paints 40% of the American population with a pretty obese brush. The dual focus of describing our beautiful land right next to lamenting our ugly politics doesn&rsquo;t really do a lot of favors to either discussion.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As I put together this new blog, I am going through old links and inspirations. I have collected a fair pile of inspirations of the design, content, and attitude sorts. Though it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising, I‚Äôm still kind taken back about how vital the attitude bits have been to getting me moving. Rereading these things is also a compounding sort of positive pressure in that it makes me want to document the inspirations. I have started preparing some of this stuff for <a href="/commonplace/">Commonplace</a>. Guess what putting things into Commonplace makes me want to do: think about and write more things. Yay!</p>

<p>At some point along the way I ran into Matt Webb‚Äôs <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak">15 rules for blogging, and my current streak</a>. I skimmed it a bit back then, but wrote it down for later discovery. It‚Äôs a very nice set of rules. I think many folks could take away some attitudes that would help them get to writing more. In fact his final rule, ‚ÄúWriting is a muscle,‚Äù is a call to write more.</p>

<p>This whole experience in finding and reminding myself of a past discovery has me shedding my hang-ups with the <a href="/ephemera/">Ephemera</a> I‚Äôm writing to this blog. As Matt says, writing is a muscle. While I don‚Äôt want to dive into the social of Twitter or its ilk, that doesn‚Äôt mean jotting off short bursts of words isn‚Äôt a valuable exercise. Maybe I should be more <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/135/">Craig Mod</a> and temper my ‚Äúpathology [of] keeping around so much digital cruft,‚Äù but right now I find the working of the muscles useful. If I change my mind, there is nothing to stop me from auto-deleting week-old digital cruft as Craig does.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In committing myself to write here at Micro.blog, I <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/14/microblogging.html">had a few hangups</a>. One unspoken in that post is the challenge of learning of a new platform. Particularly I just couldn‚Äôt write on this platform without making the look and feel of it my own. Yes, during last night‚Äôs long night I have already succeeded in failing my goal to resist customizing my Micro.blog. I enjoy tending my online garden too much.</p>

<p>It seems useful to share the experience of trying to accomplish tasks when one doesn‚Äôt know anything about how to do it. (This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">beginner‚Äôs mind</a> adjacent, but I don‚Äôt think what I‚Äôm writing about here represents any sort of a zen-level state of being.) I figured I would write out some of the experience of standing things up on the service.</p>

<p>To be very clear up front, I have quite enjoyed building up my Micro.blog knowledge. The community is incredibly supportive. I think the platform walks a pretty good line between being an accessible way to have an online presence across micro and traditional blog posts while also providing near infinite flexibility to those who really want to dig into things. Much credit must go to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and team! Back to the brain dump‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It rapidly became clear that I wasn‚Äôt going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be customized purely with CSS rather than going to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">custom themes</a>. I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is a mind-bend and I‚Äôm trying to honor <em>some</em> of the limits I set for myself.</p>

<p>I clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica">Arabica theme</a>. This process would have benefitted from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn‚Äôt <em>too</em> time consuming overall.</p>

<p>Before committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> and wondering if Micro.blog could just be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html">supports ActivityPub</a> for custom domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You Sure?‚Ñ¢ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I‚Äôd rather it sit at blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a <em>bit</em> like a ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù landing spot. Though I can read about <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19">changing domains</a>, I don‚Äôt readily see a place that I can do it in my account. Now, rather than a year from now, would be the time to deal with 48 hours of weirdness in my site. I‚Äôll have to dig around more to see if it‚Äôs possible. If it‚Äôs not possible, no big deal.</p>

<p>My goal was to structure the site with a <strong>Blog</strong>, a place for micro posts that I‚Äôm calling <strong>Ephemera</strong>, and an area to collect things I like that I‚Äôm calling <strong>Commonplace</strong>. It wasn‚Äôt incredibly obvious to me how I was going to do this. Categories seemed like a part of the solution, and I <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">found they do their job</a>. Incidentally, <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">category auto filtering</a> is pretty genius!</p>

<p>(For a few hours I really struggled to find information on how to best used the service. Eventually I realized that searching <a href="https://help.micro.blog">help.micro.blog</a> for answers worked pretty well. I‚Äôm so conditioned to web search ‚Äú[problem] [example.com]‚Äù. It‚Äôs a hard habit to break.)</p>

<p>As I thought more about the <strong>Commonplace</strong> section, I decided that should just be a manually-managed page that links out to subcategories (quotes, poetry, and so on). It was not obvious to me how to do this, but <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-category-pages/796/2">some friendly help</a> taught me that I could just make additional pages and change their URL scheme to look like <code>/categories/quotes</code>. Pretty easy in the end.</p>

<p>CSS styling has been incredibly simple and fast to implement. I‚Äôve mostly adjusted the fonts, colors, and link interactions. As a developer by trade, I naturally wish I could be editing CSS on my machine. Not having source control gets me itchy all over as well, but that‚Äôs to be expected.</p>

<p>There are some things that I still think I‚Äôd like to customize, but I wish I could do it without delving into custom themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I might like my homepage to be something more ‚Äútraditional web page‚Äù with an introduction to myself, what‚Äôs at the site, and so on.</li>
<li>Or I might like my homepage to simply be my longer-form blog posts. For me this site is a blog, with micro posts and a commonplace book alongside it. This and the above point <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-home-page/62">can be done through custom themes</a>.</li>
<li>I would like to have some intro text on my categories pages, but this again appears to require custom themes. Having some sort of smartcode or magic keyword that can be used to plop in category listings could work well. This might be an extension of how <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">categories are added to navigation</a>.</li>
<li>I would like my primary feed to be the blog feed. Secondarily, I would like to have a link to the <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/0102806d25.gif">firehose</a> for people who want it all. Custom themes!</li>
<li>On your blog posts pages, it appears you can either have replies shown or relegate them to the Micro.blog timeline. I‚Äôd like a couple of other options here in a drop down: show link to reply on Micro.blog and show link to reply via email. I think there is a plugin for the latter, so maybe a plugin will pop up at some point for the former as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I‚Äôm a bit concerned about the future Hugo upgrade process and how my customizations will play with it. At that point I will probably have to delve into <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blogs</a>. I‚Äôm thankful for their existence, but found them a little hard to approach in this initial site build up.</p>

<p>Again, Micro.blog is quite a fascinating and fun piece of software. I feel very good about my choice to jump in and give it a try!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I like to watch art movies. While I don‚Äôt only attend art house movie theaters, it‚Äôs definitely worthwhile to me to sprinkle some such movies into my regular viewing. I‚Äôm more than entertained with a lot of Hollywood properties, but it is a fact that most of those movies do not offer surprises that you‚Äôve never seen on screen before.</p>

<p>Some movies-as-art that I‚Äôve watched in the past few months are <em>A Ghost Story</em>, <em>Annette</em>, and <em>The Power of the Dog</em>. The former two are certainly different from any movies I‚Äôve ever watched before. The latter doesn‚Äôt feel all that unique on the surface, but offers a depth of experience that keeps giving long after the credits roll.</p>

<p>A big hangup folks have with movie art is one I think we each have with at least some of the art out there: they don‚Äôt understand and the art makes them feel stupid. What is the most common response to something that makes you feel stupid? Call the thing the thing it makes you feel: Stupid!</p>

<p>The lesson I try to take with me from my enjoyment of art movies is that I rarely understand the layers being presented while I watch the movie, and I rarely figure out the layers on my own after the movie is completed. The best I usually do is to have a sense that, hey, something was going on there and I bet this or that meant a thing. If I viewed the movie with someone else, we then get to discuss what just happened, trying to puzzle it out for ourselves. We eventually hit the Internet to read the thoughts of others, background on the movie, and so on.</p>

<p>The meaning of movie art is not a thing I understand immediately, but a thing that provides a depth of experience factory farmed movies don‚Äôt quite satisfy. It‚Äôs like admitting that, yes, a Big Mac (or Filet o‚Äô Fish) is tasty, but it doesn‚Äôt offer the same experience as a restaurant with an intentional menu of deep flavors. Sometimes I want that easy hit of dopamine, but I do enjoy mixing in meals with more layers of flavor. If I can‚Äôt quite describe what that flavor is, part of the fun is sorting it out with the people around me.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A friend of mine has a genius habit that I could not help but copy. He starts every morning with five or ten minutes of poetry reading. It‚Äôs not that he loves poetry, though he‚Äôs learning to like it. It‚Äôs more that the written word of poetry is very different from prose and it disrupts the internal monologue going on in his head.</p>

<p>What a great idea! It immediately clicked with me as something worth trying to develop a habit around. I‚Äôve tried meditation and other things to train and calm my mind, but for whatever reason those habits have never had a strong impact on my daily moods. Reading poetry sounded to me like an activity, if not the same as meditation, of a quality that might take my mind in similar directions.</p>

<p>For someone who doesn‚Äôt have a habit of reading poetry, I actually have a reasonable collection of poetry books. On top of exercising the word processing of my mind, this exercise would hit another sweet spot for me. It causes me stress to have books or other media on a shelf, unconsumed. I was pretty sure that reading some of the books collecting dust on my shelf would make me feel better as each book is completed.</p>

<p>For the past month or so I‚Äôve tried my best to keep up on this habit. I‚Äôm jumping between a few collections at the same time, but I did finally complete one: <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/postcolonial-love-poem-poems/9781644450147"><em>Postcolonial Love Poem</em></a> by Natalie Diaz. This is not a recommendation in that I didn‚Äôt particularly understand anything I was reading. However, there was one bit I highlighted from ‚ÄúSnake-Light‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a snake swallows its prey,
a row of inner teeth help walk the jaw
over the prey‚Äôs body‚Äîwalking like reading.</p>

<p>Walking over a word with the teeth of our mind.</p>

<p>To write is to be eaten. To read, to be full.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs vivid!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In the town where I live, the middle of November begins what we call ‚Äúeven/odd parking season.‚Äù This is a time of year where, if you are parking on the street, you need to be aware of today‚Äôs date, tomorrow‚Äôs date, the house numbers on the street in which you are parking, and the city plowing rules as related to those numbers. Some folks find it pretty straightforward to do these mental gymnastics, but I just wanted a web page to tell me what to do.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.owatonnaparking.com">Owatonna Even/Odd Parking</a>. This page simplifies the winter parking rules of my city into a simple statement: Park on the even/odd side of the street. You can load it up at the website or install it as an app by <a href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/">adding it to your home screen</a>. Hope this helps a few of you out there who live near me!</p>
