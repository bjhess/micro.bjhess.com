         	<p>I‚Äôm standing up a prototype app using Rails and <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>. It wasn‚Äôt too hard to figure out how to get things going - Render‚Äôs docs have been pretty good! But I figured it is worth jotting down a few pointers about what I had to do right now while using a Render <a href="https://render.com/docs/native-environments">native environment</a> and Rails 7.0.1.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Rails guide on <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html">Active Storage</a> is generally great.</li>
<li>You will be using <a href="https://render-web.onrender.com/docs/disks">Render Disks</a> for storage, which means you can no longer stay on the free plan.</li>
<li>Of the available image processing options, Render‚Äôs native environments only include <a href="https://imagemagick.org">imagemagick</a> out of the box, so you will have to use MiniMagick for your processor.

<ul>
<li>This means <code>brew install imagemagick</code></li>
<li>Rails is transitioning to preferring <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-vips/Vips/Image">Vips</a>. While it <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/44211#issuecomment-1017743763">is not documented yet</a>, you will need <code>config.active_storage.variant_processor = :mini_magick</code> in <code>application.rb</code> to get things working.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When setting up your <a href="https://render-web.onrender.com/docs/disks">Disk</a>, note your mount path. I used <code>/storage</code>.</li>
<li>Your <code>storage.yml</code> for production should look something like this:<br /></li>
</ul>

<pre>
production_local:
  service: Disk
  root: '/storage'
</pre>

<ul>
<li><code>config/environments/production.rb</code> needs:<br /></li>
</ul>

<pre>
config.active_storage.service = :production_local

<p>I like how Nick Offerman writes. It inspires me to be more playful with my scribbles. Maybe I can be a little janky, leave some words out, and use a fancy phrase or five for fun. There&rsquo;s definitely a schtick to it and he can spread it too thick at times. One of the themes in the book is &ldquo;nuance,&rdquo; which makes it striking when Offerman paints 40% of the American population with a pretty obese brush. The dual focus of describing our beautiful land right next to lamenting our ugly politics doesn&rsquo;t really do a lot of favors to either discussion.</p>

         	<p>As I put together this new blog, I am going through old links and inspirations. I have collected a fair pile of inspirations of the design, content, and attitude sorts. Though it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising, I‚Äôm still kind taken back about how vital the attitude bits have been to getting me moving. Rereading these things is also a compounding sort of positive pressure in that it makes me want to document the inspirations. I have started preparing some of this stuff for <a href="/commonplace/">Commonplace</a>. Guess what putting things into Commonplace makes me want to do: think about and write more things. Yay!</p>

<p>At some point along the way I ran into Matt Webb‚Äôs <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak">15 rules for blogging, and my current streak</a>. I skimmed it a bit back then, but wrote it down for later discovery. It‚Äôs a very nice set of rules. I think many folks could take away some attitudes that would help them get to writing more. In fact his final rule, ‚ÄúWriting is a muscle,‚Äù is a call to write more.</p>

<p>This whole experience in finding and reminding myself of a past discovery has me shedding my hang-ups with the <a href="/ephemera/">Ephemera</a> I‚Äôm writing to this blog. As Matt says, writing is a muscle. While I don‚Äôt want to dive into the social of Twitter or its ilk, that doesn‚Äôt mean jotting off short bursts of words isn‚Äôt a valuable exercise. Maybe I should be more <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/135/">Craig Mod</a> and temper my ‚Äúpathology [of] keeping around so much digital cruft,‚Äù but right now I find the working of the muscles useful.

        <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/15/beginners-mind-microblog.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-01-15 14:45:00 -0600">Jan 15, 2022</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In committing myself to write here at Micro.blog, I <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/14/microblogging.html">had a few hangups</a>. One unspoken in that post is the challenge of learning of a new platform. Particularly I just couldn‚Äôt write on this platform without making the look and feel of it my own. Yes, during last night‚Äôs long night I have already succeeded in failing my goal to resist customizing my Micro.blog. I enjoy tending my online garden too much.</p>

<p>It seems useful to share the experience of trying to accomplish tasks when one doesn‚Äôt know anything about how to do it. (This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">beginner‚Äôs mind</a> adjacent, but I don‚Äôt think what I‚Äôm writing about here represents any sort of a zen-level state of being.) I figured I would write out some of the experience of standing things up on the service.</p>

<p>To be very clear up front, I have quite enjoyed building up my Micro.blog knowledge. The community is incredibly supportive. I think the platform walks a pretty good line between being an accessible way to have an online presence across micro and traditional blog posts while also providing near infinite flexibility to those who really want to dig into things. Much credit must go to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and team! Back to the brain dump‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It rapidly became clear that I wasn‚Äôt going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be customized purely with CSS rather than going to <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59">custom themes</a>. I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is a mind-bend and I‚Äôm trying to honor <em>some</em> of the limits I set for myself.</p>

<p>I clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica">Arabica theme</a>. This process would have benefitted from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn‚Äôt <em>too</em> time consuming overall.</p>

<p>Before committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> and wondering if Micro.blog could just be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html">supports ActivityPub</a> for custom domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You Sure?‚Ñ¢ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I‚Äôd rather it sit at blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a <em>bit</em> like a ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù landing spot. Though I can read about <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19">changing domains</a>, I don‚Äôt readily see a place that I can do it in my account. Now, rather than a year from now, would be the time to deal with 48 hours of weirdness in my site. I‚Äôll have to dig around more to see if it‚Äôs possible. If it‚Äôs not possible, no big deal.</p>

<p>My goal was to structure the site with a <strong>Blog</strong>, a place for micro posts that I‚Äôm calling <strong>Ephemera</strong>, and an area to collect things I like that I‚Äôm calling <strong>Commonplace</strong>. It wasn‚Äôt incredibly obvious to me how I was going to do this. Categories seemed like a part of the solution, and I <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">found they do their job</a>. Incidentally, <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">category auto filtering</a> is pretty genius!</p>

<p>(For a few hours I really struggled to find information on how to best used the service. Eventually I realized that searching <a href="https://help.micro.blog">help.micro.blog</a> for answers worked pretty well. I‚Äôm so conditioned to web search ‚Äú[problem] [example.com]‚Äù. It‚Äôs a hard habit to break.)</p>

<p>As I thought more about the <strong>Commonplace</strong> section, I decided that should just be a manually-managed page that links out to subcategories (quotes, poetry, and so on). It was not obvious to me how to do this, but <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-category-pages/796/2">some friendly help</a> taught me that I could just make additional pages and change their URL scheme to look like <code>/categories/quotes</code>. Pretty easy in the end.</p>

<p>CSS styling has been incredibly simple and fast to implement. I‚Äôve mostly adjusted the fonts, colors, and link interactions. As a developer by trade, I naturally wish I could be editing CSS on my machine. Not having source control gets me itchy all over as well, but that‚Äôs to be expected.</p>

<p>There are some things that I still think I‚Äôd like to customize, but I wish I could do it without delving into custom themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I might like my homepage to be something more ‚Äútraditional web page‚Äù with an introduction to myself, what‚Äôs at the site, and so on.</li>
<li>Or I might like my homepage to simply be my longer-form blog posts. For me this site is a blog, with micro posts and a commonplace book alongside it. This and the above point <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-home-page/62">can be done through custom themes</a>.</li>
<li>I would like to have some intro text on my categories pages, but this again appears to require custom themes. Having some sort of smartcode or magic keyword that can be used to plop in category listings could work well. This might be an extension of how <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68">categories are added to navigation</a>.</li>
<li>I would like my primary feed to be the blog feed. Secondarily, I would like to have a link to the <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/0102806d25.gif">firehose</a> for people who want it all. Custom themes!</li>
<li>On your blog posts pages, it appears you can either have replies shown or relegate them to the Micro.blog timeline. I‚Äôd like a couple of other options here in a drop down: show link to reply on Micro.blog and show link to reply via email. I think there is a plugin for the latter, so maybe a plugin will pop up at some point for the former as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I‚Äôm a bit concerned about the future Hugo upgrade process and how my customizations will play with it. At that point I will probably have to delve into <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html">test blogs</a>. I‚Äôm thankful for their existence, but found them a little hard to approach in this initial site build up.</p>

<p>Again, Micro.blog is quite a fascinating and fun piece of software. I feel very good about my choice to jump in and give it a try!</p>

         	<p>I have decided to give Micro.blog an honest try in 2022. This means I am moving my blogging presence off my <a href="http://bjhess.com">own platform</a> to this one. You can dig back to my post archives <a href="http://bjhess.com/blog/archive">at my site</a>.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://micro.blog/pimoore">@pimoore</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://pimoore.ca/2021/09/30/the-macro-of.html">The Macro of Micro.blog</a>, I am trying to get over my archivist desires to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Import all of my history to Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s a distraction from writing and the true archiving of thoughts and experiences.</li>
<li>Concern myself with some future where Micro.blog gets bought, I want to move on, and all of my stuff needs exported/imported/moved. Hopefully it won&rsquo;t happen, and if it does I&rsquo;ll do something then.</li>
<li>Resist my incessant need to ‚Äústyle‚Äù and customize my things. I can save that for other projects.</li>

        <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/10/why-i-enjoy.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-01-10 11:42:00 -0600">Jan 10, 2022</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I like to watch art movies. While I don‚Äôt only attend art house movie theaters, it‚Äôs definitely worthwhile to me to sprinkle some such movies into my regular viewing. I‚Äôm more than entertained with a lot of Hollywood properties, but it is a fact that most of those movies do not offer surprises that you‚Äôve never seen on screen before.</p>

<p>Some movies-as-art that I‚Äôve watched in the past few months are <em>A Ghost Story</em>, <em>Annette</em>, and <em>The Power of the Dog</em>. The former two are certainly different from any movies I‚Äôve ever watched before. The latter doesn‚Äôt feel all that unique on the surface, but offers a depth of experience that keeps giving long after the credits roll.</p>

<p>A big hangup folks have with movie art is one I think we each have with at least some of the art out there: they don‚Äôt understand and the art makes them feel stupid. What is the most common response to something that makes you feel stupid? Call the thing the thing it makes you feel: Stupid!</p>

<p>The lesson I try to take with me from my enjoyment of art movies is that I rarely understand the layers being presented while I watch the movie, and I rarely figure out the layers on my own after the movie is completed. The best I usually do is to have a sense that, hey, something was going on there and I bet this or that meant a thing. If I viewed the movie with someone else, we then get to discuss what just happened, trying to puzzle it out for ourselves. We eventually hit the Internet to read the thoughts of others, background on the movie, and so on.</p>

<p>The meaning of movie art is not a thing I understand immediately, but a thing that provides a depth of experience factory farmed movies don‚Äôt quite satisfy. It‚Äôs like admitting that, yes, a Big Mac (or Filet o‚Äô Fish) is tasty, but it doesn‚Äôt offer the same experience as a restaurant with an intentional menu of deep flavors. Sometimes I want that easy hit of dopamine, but I do enjoy mixing in meals with more layers of flavor. If I can‚Äôt quite describe what that flavor is, part of the fun is sorting it out with the people around me.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A friend of mine has a genius habit that I could not help but copy. He starts every morning with five or ten minutes of poetry reading. It‚Äôs not that he loves poetry, though he‚Äôs learning to like it. It‚Äôs more that the written word of poetry is very different from prose and it disrupts the internal monologue going on in his head.</p>

<p>What a great idea! It immediately clicked with me as something worth trying to develop a habit around. I‚Äôve tried meditation and other things to train and calm my mind, but for whatever reason those habits have never had a strong impact on my daily moods. Reading poetry sounded to me like an activity, if not the same as meditation, of a quality that might take my mind in similar directions.</p>

<p>For someone who doesn‚Äôt have a habit of reading poetry, I actually have a reasonable collection of poetry books. On top of exercising the word processing of my mind, this exercise would hit another sweet spot for me. It causes me stress to have books or other media on a shelf, unconsumed. I was pretty sure that reading some of the books collecting dust on my shelf would make me feel better as each book is completed.</p>

<p>For the past month or so I‚Äôve tried my best to keep up on this habit. I‚Äôm jumping between a few collections at the same time, but I did finally complete one: <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/postcolonial-love-poem-poems/9781644450147"><em>Postcolonial Love Poem</em></a> by Natalie Diaz. This is not a recommendation in that I didn‚Äôt particularly understand anything I was reading. However, there was one bit I highlighted from ‚ÄúSnake-Light‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a snake swallows its prey,
a row of inner teeth help walk the jaw
over the prey‚Äôs body‚Äîwalking like reading.</p>

<p>Walking over a word with the teeth of our mind.</p>

<p>To write is to be eaten. To read, to be full.</p>

         	<p>In the town where I live, the middle of November begins what we call ‚Äúeven/odd parking season.‚Äù This is a time of year where, if you are parking on the street, you need to be aware of today‚Äôs date, tomorrow‚Äôs date, the house numbers on the street in which you are parking, and the city plowing rules as related to those numbers. Some folks find it pretty straightforward to do these mental gymnastics, but I just wanted a web page to tell me what to do.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.owatonnaparking.com">Owatonna Even/Odd Parking</a>. This page simplifies the winter parking rules of my city into a simple statement: Park on the even/odd side of the street. You can load it up at the website or install it as an app by <a href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/">adding it to your home screen</a>.
