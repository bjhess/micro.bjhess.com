				"content_html": "<p>Through the years I have participated in all sorts of groups. There have been sports teams, both individually focused and team focused. There have been staff positions, working as a group to support students. There have been traditional jobs, which generally combine both the individual competition with group support.</p>\n\n<p>Out of all these my favorite form of group activity has been the musical group. A successful musical group is trying to lift everyone in the group up. While there are often soloists and “star players,” the importance of each participant is nearly identical. So the group tries to encourage and inspire their lesser players to rise to the occasion.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t seem to result in a homogenization of talent, but rather a growth of skills across all the participants. Everyone feels like they could be better. Everyone’s efforts matter. My high school band director liked to compare it to athletic teams when he would say, “Everyone’s a starter.”</p>\n\n<p>It strikes me as curious that there are not a lot of successful examples of this attitude in business. I’ve seen some similarities as I’ve looked at young businesses. On paper they have the intention to be a supportive group that builds each other up. As they grow they write <em>more</em> about this intention while building structures directly in conflict with that goal. Creating salary bands and role differentiation that explicitly says, “These jobs are not of the same value.”</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if a business could be built and maintained in a way that carries on indefinitely the idea of a supportive group where everyone is a starter? I wonder if human nature would allow the participants to maintain that attitude over many years of working together? I wonder how compensation could be defined to best support this structure?</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to leave those things as questions for now. Perhaps they are good fodder for future thinking.</p>\n",

It allows you to collect a group of tabs into a sort of dynamic group bookmark. I love this feature!</p>\n\n<p>For example, I have a tab group for blogging. It started with the following tabs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a>, which is where I post</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bjhess/627249fdc95a8e71254de79a3e4e9647\">GitHub Gist</a> that includes copy-paste intros for my micro posts</li>\n<li>A search window for finding screencaps</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://edit.photo\">edit.photo</a> for resizing said images</li>\n<li>Then tabs for linking microposts to movie, music, book, video game, and board game information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This just sounds like a folder of bookmarks, but it’s not. The grouping is dynamic. This means when you close all the tabs and reopen them later, the pages you were on in the last session are still there even if those pages are different from when you first created the tab group.

I haven’t used this much, but these tab groups are available across my computer and phone and tablet. I think the best use case of this would be if you’re, say, researching a new lawn mower. If you had some time waiting in your car for school to let out, open the tab group and find the latest tab you were reading about the subject.

The community is incredibly supportive. I think the platform walks a pretty good line between being an accessible way to have an online presence across micro and traditional blog posts while also providing near infinite flexibility to those who really want to dig into things. Much credit must go to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\">@manton</a> and team! Back to the brain dump…</p>\n\n<p>It rapidly became clear that I wasn’t going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be customized purely with CSS rather than going to <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59\">custom themes</a>. I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> is a mind-bend and I’m trying to honor <em>some</em> of the limits I set for myself.</p>\n\n<p>I clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica\">Arabica theme</a>. This process would have benefitted from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn’t <em>too</em> time consuming overall.</p>\n\n<p>Before committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)\">Mastodon</a> and wondering if Micro.blog could just be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html\">supports ActivityPub</a> for custom domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You Sure?™ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I’d rather it sit at blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a <em>bit</em> like a “proprietary” landing spot. Though I can read about <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19\">changing domains</a>, I don’t readily see a place that I can do it in my account. Now, rather than a year from now, would be the time to deal with 48 hours of weirdness in my site. I’ll have to dig around more to see if it’s possible. If it’s not possible, no big deal.</p>\n\n<p>My goal was to structure the site with a <strong>Blog</strong>, a place for micro posts that I’m calling <strong>Ephemera</strong>, and an area to collect things I like that I’m calling <strong>Commonplace</strong>. It wasn’t incredibly obvious to me how I was going to do this. Categories seemed like a part of the solution, and I <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68\">found they do their job</a>. Incidentally, <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68\">category auto filtering</a> is pretty genius!</p>\n\n<p>(For a few hours I really struggled to find information on how to best used the service. Eventually I realized that searching <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog\">help.micro.blog</a> for answers worked pretty well. I’m so conditioned to web search “[problem] [example.com]”. It’s a hard habit to break.)</p>\n\n<p>As I thought more about the <strong>Commonplace</strong> section, I decided that should just be a manually-managed page that links out to subcategories (quotes, poetry, and so on). It was not obvious to me how to do this, but <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-category-pages/796/2\">some friendly help</a> taught me that I could just make additional pages and change their URL scheme to look like <code>/categories/quotes</code>. Pretty easy in the end.</p>\n\n<p>CSS styling has been incredibly simple and fast to implement. I’ve mostly adjusted the fonts, colors, and link interactions. As a developer by trade, I naturally wish I could be editing CSS on my machine. Not having source control gets me itchy all over as well, but that’s to be expected.</p>\n\n<p>There are some things that I still think I’d like to customize, but I wish I could do it without delving into custom themes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I might like my homepage to be something more “traditional web page” with an introduction to myself, what’s at the site, and so on.</li>\n<li>Or I might like my homepage to simply be my longer-form blog posts. For me this site is a blog, with micro posts and a commonplace book alongside it. This and the above point <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-home-page/62\">can be done through custom themes</a>.</li>\n<li>I would like to have some intro text on my categories pages, but this again appears to require custom themes. Having some sort of smartcode or magic keyword that can be used to plop in category listings could work well. This might be an extension of how <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68\">categories are added to navigation</a>.</li>\n<li>I would like my primary feed to be the blog feed. Secondarily, I would like to have a link to the <a href=\"https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/0102806d25.gif\">firehose</a> for people who want it all. Custom themes!</li>\n<li>On your blog posts pages, it appears you can either have replies shown or relegate them to the Micro.blog timeline. I’d like a couple of other options here in a drop down: show link to reply on Micro.blog and show link to reply via email. I think there is a plugin for the latter, so maybe a plugin will pop up at some point for the former as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, I’m a bit concerned about the future Hugo upgrade process and how my customizations will play with it. At that point I will probably have to delve into <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html\">test blogs</a>. I’m thankful for their existence, but found them a little hard to approach in this initial site build up.</p>\n\n<p>Again, Micro.blog is quite a fascinating and fun piece of software. I feel very good about my choice to jump in and give it a try!</p>\n",

Back to the brain dump…\n\nIt rapidly became clear that I wasn’t going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be customized purely with CSS rather than going to [custom themes](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59). I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a mind-bend and I’m trying to honor _some_ of the limits I set for myself.\n\nI clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the [Arabica theme](https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica). This process would have benefitted from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn’t _too_ time consuming overall.\n\nBefore committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) and wondering if Micro.blog could just be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog [supports ActivityPub](https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html) for custom domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You Sure?™ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time. \n\nFast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I’d rather it sit at blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a _bit_ like a “proprietary” landing spot. Though I can read about [changing domains](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19), I don’t readily see a place that I can do it in my account. Now, rather than a year from now, would be the time to deal with 48 hours of weirdness in my site. I’ll have to dig around more to see if it’s possible. If it’s not possible, no big deal.\n\nMy goal was to structure the site with a **Blog**, a place for micro posts that I’m calling **Ephemera**, and an area to collect things I like that I’m calling **Commonplace**. It wasn’t incredibly obvious to me how I was going to do this. Categories seemed like a part of the solution, and I [found they do their job](https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68). Incidentally, [category auto filtering](https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68) is pretty genius!\n\n(For a few hours I really struggled to find information on how to best used the service. Eventually I realized that searching [help.micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog) for answers worked pretty well. I’m so conditioned to web search “[problem] [example.com]”. It’s a hard habit to break.)\n\nAs I thought more about the **Commonplace** section, I decided that should just be a manually-managed page that links out to subcategories (quotes, poetry, and so on). It was not obvious to me how to do this, but [some friendly help](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-category-pages/796/2) taught me that I could just make additional pages and change their URL scheme to look like `/categories/quotes`. Pretty easy in the end.\n\nCSS styling has been incredibly simple and fast to implement. I’ve mostly adjusted the fonts, colors, and link interactions. As a developer by trade, I naturally wish I could be editing CSS on my machine. Not having source control gets me itchy all over as well, but that’s to be expected.\n\nThere are some things that I still think I’d like to customize, but I wish I could do it without delving into custom themes:\n\n* I might like my homepage to be something more “traditional web page” with an introduction to myself, what’s at the site, and so on.\n* Or I might like my homepage to simply be my longer-form blog posts. For me this site is a blog, with micro posts and a commonplace book alongside it. This and the above point [can be done through custom themes](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-home-page/62).\n* I would like to have some intro text on my categories pages, but this again appears to require custom themes. Having some sort of smartcode or magic keyword that can be used to plop in category listings could work well. This might be an extension of how [categories are added to navigation](https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68).\n* I would like my primary feed to be the blog feed. Secondarily, I would like to have a link to the [firehose](https://micro.bjhess.com/uploads/2022/0102806d25.gif) for people who want it all. Custom themes!\n* On your blog posts pages, it appears you can either have replies shown or relegate them to the Micro.blog timeline. I’d like a couple of other options here in a drop down: show link to reply on Micro.blog and show link to reply via email. I think there is a plugin for the latter, so maybe a plugin will pop up at some point for the former as well.\n\nFinally, I’m a bit concerned about the future Hugo upgrade process and how my customizations will play with it. At that point I will probably have to delve into [test blogs](https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html). I’m thankful for their existence, but found them a little hard to approach in this initial site build up.\n\nAgain, Micro.blog is quite a fascinating and fun piece of software. I feel very good about my choice to jump in and give it a try!\n",
