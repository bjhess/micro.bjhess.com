				"content_html": "<p>In committing myself to write here at Micro.blog, I <a href=\"https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/14/microblogging.html\">had a few hangups</a>. One unspoken in that post is the challenge of learning of a new platform. Particularly I just couldn‚Äôt write on this platform without making the look and feel of it my own. Yes, during last night‚Äôs long night I have already succeeded in failing my goal to resist customizing my Micro.blog. I enjoy tending my online garden too much.</p>\n\n<p>It seems useful to share the experience of trying to accomplish tasks when one doesn‚Äôt know anything about how to do it. (This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin\">beginner‚Äôs mind</a> adjacent, but I don‚Äôt think what I‚Äôm writing about here represents any sort of a zen-level state of being.) I figured I would write out some of the experience of standing things up on the service.</p>\n\n<p>To be very clear up front, I have quite enjoyed building up my Micro.blog knowledge. The community is incredibly supportive. I think the platform walks a pretty good line between being an accessible way to have an online presence across micro and traditional blog posts while also providing near infinite flexibility to those who really want to dig into things. Much credit must go to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\">@manton</a> and team! Back to the brain dump‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>It rapidly became clear that I wasn‚Äôt going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be customized purely with CSS rather than going to <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59\">custom themes</a>. I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> is a mind-bend and I‚Äôm trying to honor <em>some</em> of the limits I set for myself.</p>\n\n<p>I clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica\">Arabica theme</a>. This process would have benefitted from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn‚Äôt <em>too</em> time consuming overall.</p>\n\n<p>Before committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)\">Mastodon</a> and wondering if Micro.blog could just be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html\">supports ActivityPub</a> for custom domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You Sure?‚Ñ¢ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I‚Äôd rather it sit at blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a <em>bit</em> like a ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù landing spot. Though I can read about <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19\">changing domains</a>, I don‚Äôt readily see a place that I can do it in my account.

				"content_text": "In committing myself to write here at Micro.blog, I [had a few hangups](https://micro.bjhess.com/2022/01/14/microblogging.html). One unspoken in that post is the challenge of learning of a new platform. Particularly I just couldn‚Äôt write on this platform without making the look and feel of it my own. Yes, during last night‚Äôs long night I have already succeeded in failing my goal to resist customizing my Micro.blog. I enjoy tending my online garden too much.\n\nIt seems useful to share the experience of trying to accomplish tasks when one doesn‚Äôt know anything about how to do it. (This is [beginner‚Äôs mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) adjacent, but I don‚Äôt think what I‚Äôm writing about here represents any sort of a zen-level state of being.) I figured I would write out some of the experience of standing things up on the service.\n\nTo be very clear up front, I have quite enjoyed building up my Micro.blog knowledge. The community is incredibly supportive. I think the platform walks a pretty good line between being an accessible way to have an online presence across micro and traditional blog posts while also providing near infinite flexibility to those who really want to dig into things. Much credit must go to [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) and team! Back to the brain dump‚Ä¶\n\nIt rapidly became clear that I wasn‚Äôt going to allow myself to just roll with a theme as is, so the first step was finding a theme that I felt had the bones of what I was looking for. I wanted something that could be customized purely with CSS rather than going to [custom themes](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-themes/59). I suspect I will not be able to avoid custom themes forever, but at the moment [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a mind-bend and I‚Äôm trying to honor _some_ of the limits I set for myself.\n\nI clicked through each theme, waiting for my pages to rebuild, and eventually selected the [Arabica theme](https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-arabica). This process would have benefitted from a more real-time-ish theme chooser, but it wasn‚Äôt _too_ time consuming overall.\n\nBefore committing to Micro.blog, I was experimenting with [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) and wondering if Micro.blog could just be a sort of feed aggregator. Micro.blog [supports ActivityPub](https://www.manton.org/2018/11/14/activitypub-for-your.html) for custom domains, but to my memory there was a big warning that this is A One Time Setting You Cannot Change Are You Sure?‚Ñ¢ I chose micro.bjhess.com as my domain as it made good sense at the time. \n\nFast forward to today. My Micro.blog account is really meant to be a blog. I‚Äôd rather it sit at blog.bjhess.com. The current micro.bjhess.com feels a _bit_ like a ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù landing spot. Though I can read about [changing domains](https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-domains/53/19), I don‚Äôt readily see a place that I can do it in my account. Now, rather than a year from now, would be the time to deal with 48 hours of weirdness in my site. I‚Äôll have to dig around more to see if it‚Äôs possible. If it‚Äôs not possible, no big deal.\n\nMy goal was to structure the site with a **Blog**, a place for micro posts that I‚Äôm calling **Ephemera**, and an area to collect things I like that I‚Äôm calling **Commonplace**. It wasn‚Äôt incredibly obvious to me how I was going to do this. Categories seemed like a part of the solution, and I [found they do their job](https://help.micro.blog/t/using-categories/68).

I‚Äôve tried meditation and other things to train and calm my mind, but for whatever reason those habits have never had a strong impact on my daily moods. Reading poetry sounded to me like an activity, if not the same as meditation, of a quality that might take my mind in similar directions.\n\nFor someone who doesn‚Äôt have a habit of reading poetry, I actually have a reasonable collection of poetry books. On top of exercising the word processing of my mind, this exercise would hit another sweet spot for me. It causes me stress to have books or other media on a shelf, unconsumed. I was pretty sure that reading some of the books collecting dust on my shelf would make me feel better as each book is completed.\n\nFor the past month or so I‚Äôve tried my best to keep up on this habit. I‚Äôm jumping between a few collections at the same time, but I did finally complete one: [_Postcolonial Love Poem_](https://bookshop.org/books/postcolonial-love-poem-poems/9781644450147) by Natalie Diaz. This is not a recommendation in that I didn‚Äôt particularly understand anything I was reading. However, there was one bit I highlighted from ‚ÄúSnake-Light‚Äù:\n\n> When a snake swallows its prey,\n> a row of inner teeth help walk the jaw\n> over the prey‚Äôs body‚Äîwalking like reading.\n>  \n> Walking over a word with the teeth of our mind.\n>  \n> To write is to be eaten. To read, to be full.\n\nThat‚Äôs vivid!\n",
