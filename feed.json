				"content_text": "I have decided to give Micro.blog an honest try in 2022. This means I am moving my blogging presence off my [own platform](http://bjhess.com) to this one. You can dig back to my post archives [at my site](http://bjhess.com/blog/archive). \r\n\r\nInspired by [@pimoore](https://micro.blog/pimoore)'s [The Macro of Micro.blog](https://pimoore.ca/2021/09/30/the-macro-of.html), I am trying to get over my archivist desires to:\r\n\r\n1. Import all of my history to Micro.blog. It's a distraction from writing and the true archiving of thoughts and experiences.\r\n2. Concern myself with some future where Micro.blog gets bought, I want to move on, and all of my stuff needs exported/imported/moved. Hopefully it won't happen, and if it does I'll do something then.\r\n3. Resist my incessant need to ‚Äústyle‚Äù and customize my things. I can save that for other projects.\r\n",
